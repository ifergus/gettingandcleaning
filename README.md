This repository contains a solution that demonstrates how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data used for this demonstration leverages the Human *Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.* Initially, a large data set is created by combining both test and traning data.  
Finally, a tidy data set is created by taking the average of each variable for each activity and each subject of the large data set.
